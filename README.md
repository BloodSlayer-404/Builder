### Introduction:
This is an example of the creational design pattern called "Builder" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example tries to create an easy way to generate zombies and equipment (Armor and weapons) with specific characteristics, without putting all those parameters in the class's constructor each time you need an object with those characteristics.

You can create new recipes for objects with specific values for the attributes, setting them in a method inside the Director class, to save the recipe of that object in case you need another one.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Builder/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Builder/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
